Feature: Connect an external messaging service through channels
  In order to bring external conversations into a Figurate workspace
  As a third-party service
  I want to configure a channel route and address through the API

  Background:
    Given an API subject exists
    And an accessible space exists as "space_id"
    And the client "support-messaging-service" has these abilities:
      | nodes:read     |
      | nodes:write    |
      | channels:manage |
      | forms:submit   |

  Scenario: Route an inbound support message into an addressed thread
    When the client sends a "POST" request to "/api/nodes" with JSON:
      """
